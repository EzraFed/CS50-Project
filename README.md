    This website serves as a platform for the creation, collaboration, and sharing of documents and information. The website was designed to have a straightforward
and intuitive interface.
    To begin using this website, change your directory to the one containing the relevant files (application.py, documents.db, templates/, static/, etc.).
Write flask run as a command-line argument in your terminal. Doing so will return a URL. Click on the URL to go to the website. The URL will lead you to the homepage.
The homepage has a navigation bar at the top with the title of the website, CollaborativeDocs. If you click on CollaborativeDocs, it will direct you to the homepage.
In the middle of the screen there are also five categories of documents. Choose the category you are interested in and click next. This will lead you to the directory
page.
    The directory page displays all documents related to the chosen category of documents. They are sorted from most recent (top) to least recent (bottom). Choose
whichever document most interests you, and click read. Doing so will bring you to the document page. If the document has a password, and you have not already entered
the password during your session using the website, the document will be displayed in view-only mode. To edit the document, you must click on the edit button. Doing
so will direct you to the login page.
    The login page will prompt you for the password of the document you are attempting to access. After writing the password in the text input space, click submit.
If the incorrect password was submitted, you will receive an error that says you gave the wrong password. Otherwise, you will return to the document page. However,
this time you will be able to edit the document. Once you are done editing the document, make sure to click submit so that your changes are saved. If you are then
interested in viewing or editing another document, simply click on "CollaborativeDocs" in the upper left corner. This will bring you back to the homepage.
    Note that while on the directory page you may create a new document rather than access a pre-existing one. To do so, click on the button the link that says "new".
Doing so will direct you to the new page, where you will have the opportunity to enter a username and optional password for your document. If the username already
exists, you will receive an error that the username already exists. Otherwise, you document will be created and you will be directed to the document page where you
can write the document. No need to enter the password before editing: since you created the document: you can immediately start editing!
